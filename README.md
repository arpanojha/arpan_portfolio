# Data Science Projects
## [Heart Attack Prediction](https://github.com/arpanojha/Artificial_Intelligence/tree/main/heart_attack_prediction)
* Trained a competitive SVM and ANN model to make prediction on heart attack possibility in R. 
* Obtained 83% real world accuracy.
* EDA was done to check for relevance of parameters. 

## [Online shopping recommender](https://github.com/arpanojha/Artificial_Intelligence/tree/main/Market_basket_optimization)
* A amazon type recommender system for groceries
* Suggests the most commonly bought iterm pairs. 

## [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/arpanojha/Artificial_Intelligence/tree/main/misere_tic_tac_toe)
* Play tic tac toe against AI 
* It is not limited to 3X3 board. 
* AI plays using alpha beta pruning search for optimal next move. 

## [USA route finder](https://github.com/arpanojha/Artificial_Intelligence/tree/main/USA_route_finder)
* Lets you choose between best route based on shortest distance, time, least number of traffic lights.
* Map is based on all cities in USA and Canada. 
* This performs similar to Google Maps. 
* AI uses A star search. 

## [MNIST](https://github.com/arpanojha/MNIST/tree/master/SVM)
* SVM classifier trained on MNIST dataset provides 98% accuracy. 

# Computer Science Projects
## [Book reading filter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sepia_filter/)
* Mozilla Firefox addon for adjusting screen brightness. 
* It adjusts screen brightness to make webpages resemble as old sheets of paper. 

# Summer Internship 
## Hindustan Aeronautics Limited May 2017
### [Swerling model on fighter jet RCS](https://github.com/arpanojha/Swerling_Model) 
* Matlab based tool precomputes plane RCS using standard models.
* Using this model and radar data the plane signature is identified even  when far away.
* Extremely robust to gaussian noise.
