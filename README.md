# Data Science Projects
## [Detecting Chickens Using Social Media Data- ongoing research](https://github.com/arpanojha/computer-vision/blob/main/final_project/poster.pdf)
* Surveyed 10 transformer and neural network models to analyze state of the art techniques in identifying chicken data.
* Classification of chicken against other images was achiceved at 99% accuracy and game v/s farm fowl was classified with 95% accuracy. 
* Classification algorithms from Alexnet in 2012 to convnext(2021) was surveyed. 
* Model o be used by University of California, Irvine researchers in helping curb rampant avian flu amongst chickens.
